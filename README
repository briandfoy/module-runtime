NAME

Module::Runtime - runtime module handling

DESCRIPTION

The functions exported by this module deal with runtime handling of
Perl modules, which are normally handled at compile time.  This module
avoids using any other modules, so that it can be used in low-level
infrastructure.

The functions of this module whose purpose is to load modules include a
workaround for Perl core bug [perl #68590] where it exists, except for
Perls 5.9.4 up to 5.10.0 where no satisfactory workaround is possible in
pure Perl.  This bug, present from Perl 5.6 up to Perl 5.10 and fixed in
Perl 5.11.0, causes lexical state in one file to leak into another that is
"require"d/"use"d from it.  The workaround means that modules loaded via
this module don't suffer this pollution of their lexical state.  Modules
loaded in other ways, or via this module on the Perl versions where
the pure Perl workaround is impossible, remain vulnerable.  The module
Lexical::SealRequireHints provides a complete workaround for this bug.
