* dependency.t failure due to sitecustomize preloading

* in upo(), try to make recognition of module non-existence specific to the topmost module being loaded: can currently be confused by an existing module that errors during loading by means of a require_module()
	+ maybe just make it error at a different line, from which errors are never propagated
	+ maybe include target module filename in pattern to match, if that can be done cross-platform
	+ maybe try a nasty trick with magic object in @INC

* does PP L:SRH break recognition of module non-existence by changing the file:line reported in the intercepted error message?
	+ test with L:SRH loaded
